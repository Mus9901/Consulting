		<div id="container-letter-img">
			<div id="container2-letter">
			<p id="subheader-02-01">The final and most involving part of any academic qualification is the project or dissertation.

			<p id="subheader-02-02">The project / dissertation is highly involving and if approached strategically and in a progressive manner it can be a very enjoyable and rewarding experience. One of the most important elements is the guidance from an expert supervisor and this is what we can provide you with at Efixis in order to enhance your learning experience.</p>
