				<h1>Doctor Nicholas Ioannides</h1>
				<h2>Managing Director<span id="fafa01" class="fa fa-minus"></span></h2>
				<h3>Career History</h3>
				<p><br><br>Nicholas is the Managing Director and a Co-Founder of Efixis. His motto is "highest quality in product and service provision with unparalleled customer satisfaction".
				<br><br><br><br>His diverse education in engineering, business and international relations, and his extensive professional experience in a variety of sectors, including management, technology, consultancy, engineering and academia, make him a multi- as well as an inter-disciplinarian. Some of the roles he occupied include Senior Lecturer, Researcher, Head of European Operations, Member of Board of Directors, Consultant, and Coordinator of External Affairs. He has also set up 3 start up companies.
				<br><br><br><br>Nicholas spent 24 years in academia as Senior Lecturer and Head of a Research Group at one of the biggest universities in London, UK. During that time, he was the coordinator of Final Year BSc and MSc projects and supervisory teams; proposed, designed and developed more than 10 new courses (BEng, MEng, MSc) and several modules; and was for more than 10 years Programme Director for 4 MSc courses. He has supervised in excess of 100 MSc and 150 BSc/BEng as well as several PhD projects to successful completion. He was also heavily involved in the tutoring and programme planning of MSc students and the career planning and coaching of more than 100 students and graduates. Furthermore, he was actively involved in the running affairs of his school as member of academic, research, recruitment and marketing committees; the IET and BCS accreditation of UG and PG courses; recruitment of students and evaluation of applications for education provision in London and also at partner colleges abroad.
				<br><br><br><br>Nicholas is very effective at organisational development and coordination of operational activities at international level. He applies suitable programme, project and product management techniques and ensures they are supported by appropriate allocation of resources. He employs agile and fit-for-purpose methodologies ensuring all organisational goals are met on time, within budget and with excellent customer service. He has proven skills in educational and career planning and coaching, technical writing, and curriculum design and development for professional and educational environments.
				<br><br><br><br>What Nicholas is most proud of is the fact that his career has enabled him to interact with and touch the lives of so many young and not-so-young people from all over the world in one of the most multicultural cities in the world. There is so much beauty, richness and wisdom that can be had when we accept, respect and embrace each other.
				<br><br><br><br>Living on the outskirts of London, Nicholas enjoys taking long walks through nature trails and reserves, and keeps on promising himself to get a nice dog soon. He is also very fond of motorsports especially Formula 1, Rallying and Superbikes. Most of all, he loves spending time with his family and friends in Cyprus, whether by the sea or on the mountains.
